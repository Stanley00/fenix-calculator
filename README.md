Scientific Calculator for Fenix & Forerunner watches
Ever wondered how a smartwatch with 5 buttons can be used as a calculator? If yes then this app is probably for you.

This full-featured calculator can be useful when shopping, doing math homework, changing currency etc. The result is evaluated on the go when the algorithm recognises a meaningful expression, hence partial results are displayed when typing. There are three evaluation modes: Traditional/Postfix/Prefix. An expression can expand into multiple lines.

IMPORTANT: EXIT can be found in the menu (press and hold UP/MENU button)!!!

USAGE ON NO TOUCHSCREEN DEVICES

- MENU (press and hold up button): access to Exit, switch between Traditional, Prefix and Postfix modes.

- Back button: access to the math operations, math constants, delete and clear.

- Start button: add new digit to the last number or add a new number to the expression.

- Up/down button: rotate between digits and decimal point.

USAGE ON TOUCHSCREEN DEVICES

- Back: usually exits the app

- Tap on the top label (Traditional/Prefix/Postfix): access to Exit, switch between Traditional, Prefix and Postfix modes.

- Tap on letter O: access to the math operations, math constants, delete and clear.

- Tap on letter D: add new digit to the last number or add a new number to the expression.

- Swipe up/down: rotate between digits and decimal point.

NOTE

Idea for the user interface was taken from https://github.com/rvk/rpncalc.

In Traditional mode `log` is implemented as a binary function e.g. 2log1024 = 10.
