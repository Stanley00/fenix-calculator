Scientific Calculator for Fenix & Forerunner watches

Ever wondered how a smartwatch with 5 buttons can be used as a calculator? If yes then this app is probably for you.

This full-featured calculator can be useful when shopping, doing math homework, changing currency etc. The result is evaluated on the go when the algorithm recognises a meaningful expression, hence partial results are displayed when typing. There are three evaluation modes: Traditional/Postfix/Prefix. An expression can expand to multiple lines.

IMPORTANT: EXIT can be found in the menu (press and hold UP/MENU button)!!!

USAGE

   - MENU long press: access to Exit, switch between Traditional, Prefix and Postfix modes.

   - Back button: access to the math operations, math constants, delete and clear.

   - Start button: add new digit to the last number or add a new number to the expression.

   - Up/down button: rotate between digits and decimal point.

NOTE

   Idea for the user interface was taken from https://github.com/rvk/rpncalc.
