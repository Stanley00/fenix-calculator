Calculate everywhere on your wrist with a scientific calculator available for both physical button and touchscreen devices.

This full-featured calculator can be useful when shopping, doing math homework, changing currency etc. There are three evaluation modes: Traditional/Postfix/Prefix. An expression can expand into multiple lines.

IMPORTANT: EXIT can be found in the menu (press and hold UP/MENU button)!!!

#### USAGE ON NON-TOUCHSCREEN DEVICES ####

- Menu (press and hold up button): access to Exit, switch between Traditional, Prefix and Postfix modes.

- Back button: access to the math operations, math constants, delete and clear.

- Start button: add new digit to the last number or add a new number to the expression.

- Up/down button: rotate between digits and decimal point.

#### USAGE ON TOUCHSCREEN DEVICES ####

- Back: usually exits the app (depending on device).

#### NOTES ####

Idea for the user interface was taken from https://github.com/rvk/rpncalc.

In Traditional mode `log` is implemented as a binary function e.g. 2log1024 = 10.

Floating point calculations are accurate up to 5 decimal places.
